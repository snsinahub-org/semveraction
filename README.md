## Examples

## How to generate new version
Let's say current version is `v1.0.0` and you can set `type` equal to one of these values 

- **MAJOR**: It is a major change to your software which may not be compatible with older releases. The new version will be `v2.1.0` 
- **MINOR**: The change is smaller and adds new features to an existing project but still compatible with the current version. The new version is `v1.1.0`
- **PATCH**: There is a bug fix without introducing new features. The new version is `v1.0.1`
